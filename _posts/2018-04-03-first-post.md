I decided to create an application that allows people in NYC to explore, order and deliver different types of desserts to their homes. I want my app to not only allow people to order desserts, but also be able check out cool and unique dessert places nearby their location. I am thinking about creating a prototype of the application and a website that would brand the product before a customer decides to download the app. I am planning to show how the app would function, some of the interactions included in the app, the values and goals of the product, and some sample situations in which a customer would have to use the applciation.

I want to name the application DessertSpot because the application allows you to spot different types of desserts in NYC. I am going to break up the dessert page into six different categories of desserts: ice cream, cupcakes, chocolate, cakes, cookies, and pastries. After one picks the type of dessert they want, the next page would be a location page in which the customer would need to put their current location or the app would locate their location, which allows the app to find places nearby. I'm planning to keep the color palette pistachio green, light pink, mint orange, peach,etc. Mostly warm colors with a tint. I have also started creating sketches for my logo.
