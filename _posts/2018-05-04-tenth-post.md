I fixed the suggestion page, so now viewers can add places that are not on the website. But, every time I refresh the page, the added location goes away, so I need to figure out how to make them stay after refreshing the page. Also, I need to add in the media queries/responsive design by the sizing of an iPhone app.

I also, worked on the bottom part of the home page, which showcases the values of this company. I am still trying to figure out what images to put next to the text.

I am still unsure if I should add in an about page, so I am going to just do it and see how it looks. I will sum up what my website is about and what is exactly for and how it is different from the other food apps.
