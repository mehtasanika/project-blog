I finished up adding the different places within each location this week and worked on the layout of the website even more. After adding in the images of each dessert place, I realized I didn't like the way I laid it out and how I displayed the text. I want the images to be bigger, load faster, and the text below to be in different font. So, this week I am going to be playing around with that. The biggest problem with the images is that they are taking too long to load. I need to make the files of each image smaller.

One thing I am having a really hard time with is adding in the interaction part. I still don't feel my site looks professional. It feels like it is still in work-mode, which it is, but it doesn't seem to be conveying what I want it to convey when someone comes up this site. I think to make that possible, I need to research on some interactions with other websites and see which ones I like and play around with those interactions by figuring out which ones would suit my site.
