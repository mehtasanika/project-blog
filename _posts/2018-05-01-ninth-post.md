I am pretty much done with the category pages because I have added in the locations of each of the places and the images. I added in the locations by adding in the hover statement for each of the images, but I kept the images transparent, so if a viewer hovers over the image to find out the location, they can still see the image and remember what they were looking for. I also, made some changes to my code for the category pages because the "position" style was messing up the top bar with the title and logo. I don't think I want to add any more information on the category pages because I think that will be too much for a viewer to take in, so now I am going to focus on the homepage, the suggestion page, and maybe add in an about page.

For my suggestion page, I want my users to suggest more places that I have maybe not into the website. So, I set up an input and output box in javascript, but for some reason the output is not working. So, I need to figure out how to make that work and how to stylize the page more.
