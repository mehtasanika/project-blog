I decided to create an application that allows people in NYC to explore, order and deliver different types of desserts to their homes. I want my app to not only allow people to order desserts, but also be able to order desserts in a easier way. I am thinking about creating a prototype of the application and a website that would brand the product before a customer decides to download the app. I am planning to show how the app would function, some of the interactions included in the app, the values and goals of the product, and some sample situations in which a customer would have to use the applciation.

I want to name the application DessertSpot because the application allows you to spot different types of desserts in NYC. I am going to break up the dessert page into six different categories of desserts: ice cream, cupcakes, chocolate, cakes, cookies, and pastries. After one picks the type of dessert they want, the next page would be a location page in which the customer would need to put their current location to allow the app to find places nearby that.
