I changed the sizing of the images in each location spot. Now I have to add in the hover and fade element in which I will add in the location's address. I am also still working on the layout of the homepage because I still don't feel like it looks professional. I also, need to figure out my suggestion page because I want people to add places that are not on my website, but maybe they know or have gone to and liked, so other people can also check them out. Also, I think I have figured out what I want to do with the bottom half of my homepage. I plan on showing the values of this app and the reason why one should use this app. I plan on doing a zig-zag model(as shown below). I plan on having an image and then text along side with it.
