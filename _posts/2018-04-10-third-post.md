After the critique on Friday, I decided to create my app through a website and to brand my app through that too. The website will look very similar to the app, just the size will change, which will be solved through media queries and I will show sketches of the app on an iphone mockup.

I created the logo of DessertSpot and I decided to to do a cupcake tier stand with a ice cream sundae on the top because I wanted to show the mixture of different desserts. However, I didn't include all desserts because I thought that would be too much to take in for one logo. I chose a tier stand because it is used for many desserts like cupcakes, cookies, cakes, and pastries. And then for the top part I chose an ice cream sundae because I thought that would be a good way to top it off and I think most people correlate dessert with ice cream.

I started working on the different categories of desserts by adding the standard design components on each page. I asked a couple of my friends what they thought about the format and logo so far and they said they really like the font choice and the logo is interesting, but they suggested to change the top part of the logo because it doesn't look exactly like a ice cream sundae. Also, they said to add more color because whenever they think of dessert, they think of different colors. So, I am planning to group each category with a color. I am still playing around with how I am displaying information about locating the places.
