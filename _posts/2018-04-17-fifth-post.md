I started off my project by first thinking of an idea that I wanted to solve through an application. The first idea that popped up in my mind was desserts. i always find it really hard to discover new desserts places on Google Maps. Therefore, I wanted to create an app that helps make the process easier. I started researching different food apps like Grubhub, seamless, doordash and checking out their websites and screen apps. I saw a lot of similarities in terms of design, branding, and directions. After looking into these apps in-depth, I realized nothing is unique about them except their name, color of logo, and font.

So, going off of that problem, I wanted to create something that didn't require you putting in your location at the very first step and didn't always require you to create an account. Therefore, I started off by breaking the desserts into categories and focusing on six different locations/areas in New York City for each type of dessert. Also, I picked out the color palette and designed the logo before I began coding. I think that was a good decision because choosing the colors I wanted from before, helped me figure out how categorize the desserts and the logo helped me get a general idea that I wanted to convey. I went through many renditions for my logo and color palette, but I think that helped me realized the things that would work and wouldn't. I have probably changed the outlook of this app multiple times, but that was the only way I learned and how to not repeat that mistake again.

The biggest mistake I made in this project so far is not design the material or pages before. I went straight to coding because I thought I had a good idea with a lot of potential and it was an idea that I'm was very close to my heart. However, once I actually started coding, I realized I couldn't do this beacause I was creating work that I wasn't proud of. So, after this version I am going to illustrate how some of the pages are going to look like and how to improve the current project to be more interactive and eye-catching. I also, need to look into media-queries because I want this app to be used in iphones too. 

I used perform user testing by timing how long someone stays at my website. I performed this user-testing by using my stop-watch and timing each individual. With this version, I asked 6 people and all of them mostly stayed on till 3-4 minutes, which I think is good because I want the app to be set in a way where people can quickly pick out a category, check out a site, and pick a place to go to. I don't want people to spend more time on it because it's not suppose to be that kind of an application. Even though my user-testers reached the time I wanted it to be around, they still wanted more interactive elements on the homepage.

The things I will change as I continue to iterate this proudct are creating sketches before coding a new set of code, adding more feel good interactive elements, media queries for iphone, and add more dessert places for each section.
