I added new design elements to the homepage. I am still playing around with the design format, but I think I came around with a solid color palette. I still want the home page to be a little bit more interactive and attractive, but I think that will happen when I add more interactions. For right now, I plan on moving the directions to the bottom of the homepage and in place of that I will be put a fast paced slide show of dessert images. I also, want to get rid of the top navigation bar because I don't like how it looks there and I might want to put it on the bottom of the homepage. So, basically I want to make a scrolling homepage.

For the dessert categories, I added in the "select a location" button and a pop up that gives the five different locations that I am probably going to focus on and pick the dessert places from. Each category is probably going to have that same pop up, but designed in their unique way. I'm still not sure how I am going to design them, but I am in the process of it because I also want to add in a moving dessert or a gif of something.

At this point, I think I need to work on interactions and how to add in more attraction elements into this website. I also need to add in media queries.

For my KPI, I will look into how long people stay on my website and look through the categories and locations. I will record that by either videoing them or timing them.
